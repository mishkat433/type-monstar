                        <strong>Local Storage : </strong>This read-only interface property provides access to the
                        Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to
                        sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends that is
                        when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed
                        (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session
                        <br>
                        <strong>Session Storage : </strong>Session Storage objects can be accessed using the
                        sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is
                        that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page
                        session ends.

                        A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                        valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or
                        the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is
                        created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each
                        tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a
                        tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a
                        window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.

                            <strong>Global Scope : </strong>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable
                            is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The
                            global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside
                            blocks.

                            <strong>Blog Scope : </strong>The main difference between the local scope and block scope is
                            that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So
                            the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same
                            scope.ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords. These two keywords are
                            scoped within the block which are defined.

                        Event is hidden by default, until the
                        JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the
                        code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite
                        different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br><br>
                        At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue,
                        starting with the oldest one. To do so, the message is removed from the queue and its
                        corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter. As always, calling a
                        function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.

                        JavaScript provides some primitive as well as non-primitive data types. For example “null”,
                        “boolean”, “undefined”, etc. belong to the primitive data type while “arrays”, and “objects” are
                        non-primitive or complex data types. In JavaScript, any variable that is not assigned with any
                        value has a default value of “undefined”.
